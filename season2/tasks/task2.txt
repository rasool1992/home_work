Q2: 
Describe the difference between var, dynamic, and explicitly typed variables in Dart.

Answer:
dynamic is data type while the var is a keyword, in dynamic data type we could change the value to another type or it may change during execution.
While with explicitly typed variables the compiler doesn't need to infer the type.
